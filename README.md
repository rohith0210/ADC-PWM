# ADC-PWM
ADC with 8051 – Demonstrates Analog-to-Digital Conversion to read analog signals (e.g., sensors) and convert them into digital values for processing by the 8051 microcontroller.  PWM with 8051 – Shows Pulse Width Modulation for controlling devices like motors, LEDs, and buzzers by varying signal duty cycle from the 8051.
